## Open Access Button Prototype

A prototype version of the Open Access Button idea explained in [this blog](http://oabutton.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/our-project-short-version/).
Our code is completely open source and we invite/need developers to get involved in this amazing project. Currently we're trying to focus on attaining our minimum viable product, described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5NV6PoUPiB8GmxRvIO0onDnv8bV69BeDGDco9uHxik/edit) before moving in to our testing phase, provisionally on October 1st. That should allow us to launch during Open Access Week, 21st October! If you have suggestions we are more than open to them however, and post this date we can think about broader developement. 
### Have a look at the [demo](http://oabutton.herokuapp.com/) - however please do not share the link as we're pre-launch! 


If you want to contribute, we have some [instructions for setting up your local dev environment](https://github.com/OAButton/server/blob/develop/instructions.md).
As mentioned, we're working to a tight deadline and many people are counting on this tool launching in Open Access Week so please try and work on high priority issues! 
If you would like to take an issue on please make a pull request and merge when finished. 
Also, we discuss the projects development more broadly on our [Google Group] (http://groups.google.com/group/open-access-button) and when possible open ended questions should be made here, rather than in issues.

If you have any questions please do send them to oabutton@gmail.com
